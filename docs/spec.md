# gosu:spec - Feature Specification Command

Act as a professional project manager, business analyst, and technical lead to create comprehensive feature specifications through guided requirements gathering and analysis.

## Overview

The `gosu:spec` command provides a specification-first approach to feature development, with Claude Code acting as your virtual PM/BA/Tech Lead team. This command guides you through creating world-class feature specifications that address business needs, technical requirements, and stakeholder expectations.

## Usage

```bash
# Interactive mode - guided specification process
claude gosu:spec

# Direct mode - specify feature description
claude gosu:spec "user profile management with avatar upload"
```

## Key Features

### 1. Professional Team Approach

Claude Code acts as your virtual team:

- **Project Manager**: Ensuring comprehensive scope definition, timeline considerations, and resource planning
- **Business Analyst**: Gathering requirements, analyzing business value, and defining success criteria
- **Technical Lead**: Assessing technical feasibility, architecture implications, and implementation approach

### 2. Specification-First Methodology

Unlike `gosu:plan` which focuses on implementation details, `gosu:spec` emphasizes:

- **Business Requirements Documentation**
- **Stakeholder Analysis with RACI Matrix**
- **User Personas and Journey Mapping**
- **SMART Acceptance Criteria Definition**
- **Comprehensive Non-functional Requirements**
- **Risk Register and Mitigation Strategies**

### 3. Four-Phase Professional Process

#### Phase 1: Initial Discovery
- Feature vision and one-sentence description
- Business context and urgency assessment
- Initial scope sizing (Small/Medium/Large)
- Known constraints identification

#### Phase 2: Structured Requirements Gathering

**A. Business Analysis Deep Dive**
- Problem statement and current state analysis
- Business value proposition (quantifiable benefits)
- Comprehensive stakeholder mapping
- Success criteria and KPI definition

- Journey mapping (AS-IS and TO-BE)
- Acceptance scenarios and use cases
- Usability and accessibility requirements

**C. Technical Requirements Assessment**
- System context and integration points
- Technical constraints and limitations
- Architecture considerations
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, reliability)
- Technical risk identification

**D. Implementation Planning**
- Phasing strategy and MVP definition
- Resource requirements and skill gaps
- Timeline considerations and dependencies
- Risk management and mitigation strategies

#### Phase 3: Specification Generation
- Professional document creation in `.gosu/spec-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md`
- Comprehensive sections covering all aspects
- Quality assurance and completeness validation

#### Phase 4: Continuous Refinement
- Clarifying questions for vague responses
- Best practice recommendations
- Risk identification and mitigation
- Alternative solution suggestions

### 4. Enterprise-Grade Specification Output

Specifications are saved in the `.gosu/` directory with professional formatting:

```
.gosu/
└── spec-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md    # Feature specification document
```

Each specification includes:

#### Document Structure
- **Header**: Document ID, version, status, classification
- **Executive Summary**: Feature overview, business case, strategic alignment
- **Stakeholder Analysis**: Matrix with engagement strategy, RACI chart
- **User Research & Personas**: Detailed personas with journey maps
- **Requirements Specification**: 
  - Functional requirements by priority (P0/P1/P2)
  - Non-functional requirements (performance, security, reliability, usability)
- **Technical Architecture**: System context, architecture, data model, API design
- **Implementation Strategy**: Development approach, release phases, risk register
- **Success Metrics**: Business KPIs, technical KPIs, measurement plan
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, UAT, performance testing
- **Documentation & Training**: Deliverables and training plans
- **Project Governance**: Approval process, change control
- **Appendices**: Glossary, references, assumptions, version history

### 5. Professional Templates

The command offers specialized templates for:

1. **SaaS Feature** - Multi-tenant, subscription-based features
2. **Enterprise Integration** - System integration specifications
3. **Mobile Application** - iOS/Android feature specs
4. **Data Pipeline** - ETL/Analytics specifications
5. **API Service** - Microservice specifications
6. **Security Feature** - Authentication/Authorization specs
7. **AI/ML Feature** - Machine learning feature specs

### 6. Quality Assurance

Before finalizing, the command ensures:

- ✓ All sections have meaningful content
- ✓ Requirements are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- ✓ Technical feasibility is assessed
- ✓ Business value is clearly articulated
- ✓ Risks are identified and mitigated
- ✓ Success metrics are defined
- ✓ Stakeholders are mapped
- ✓ Dependencies are documented

### 7. Integration with gosu:plan

Specifications can be seamlessly passed to implementation planning:

```bash
# Create specification
claude gosu:spec "user authentication system"

# After specification approval, create implementation plan
claude gosu:plan --from-spec .gosu/spec-20240712_143022.md
```

This integration automatically:
- Loads all requirements from the specification
- Creates implementation tasks based on priorities
- Generates technical tasks from architecture decisions
- Includes testing tasks from test strategy
- Adds documentation tasks from deliverables

## Workflow Options

After specification completion, you're presented with options:

```
Would you like to:
[V]iew the specification
[E]dit specific sections
[S]hare for review
[P]roceed to planning
[Q]uit
```

This enables:
1. **View** - Review the complete specification
2. **Edit** - Refine specific sections based on feedback
3. **Share** - Export for stakeholder review
4. **Plan** - Transition to `gosu:plan` for implementation
5. **Quit** - Save and exit for later review

## Best Practices

### When to Use gosu:spec

- **Before any major development** - Start with specifications
- **Complex feature requirements** - When multiple stakeholders are involved
- **Enterprise projects** - Formal documentation requirements
- **Compliance-critical features** - Regulatory or audit needs
- **Cross-team collaborations** - Ensure alignment across teams
- **Client deliverables** - Professional specifications for approval

### Professional PM/BA/Tech Lead Approach

As your virtual team, the command ensures:

1. **Clear Communication** - No jargon without explanation
2. **Realistic Expectations** - Honest about complexity and timelines
3. **Risk Awareness** - Proactive identification and mitigation
4. **Stakeholder Alignment** - Everyone understands and agrees
5. **Technical Excellence** - Best practices and standards
6. **Business Focus** - Always tied to business value

### Integration with Development Workflow

```bash
# Complete specification-to-implementation workflow
claude gosu:init                              # Initialize workspace
claude gosu:spec "feature description"        # Create specification
# ... stakeholder review and approval ...
claude gosu:plan --from-spec [spec-file]      # Create implementation plan
claude gosu:review                            # Code quality review
claude gosu:security                          # Security audit
```
