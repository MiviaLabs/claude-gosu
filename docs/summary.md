# Gosu Summary Command

**Generate comprehensive work summary reports with team productivity analysis**

The `gosu:summary` command analyzes git history and GitHub activity to create detailed reports of work completed by each contributor over a specified time period, providing both technical insights and management-focused analytics.

## Usage

```bash
claude gosu:summary [days]
```

### Parameters

- `days` (optional): Number of days to look back from today (default: 7)

### Examples

```bash
# Generate report for last 7 days (default)
claude gosu:summary

# Generate report for last 30 days
claude gosu:summary 30

#### File Structure
```
.gosu/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ work-summary-2024-07-01-to-2024-07-07-7days.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ work-summary-2024-07-01-to-2024-07-31-30days.md

## Key Features

### Language Agnostic Analysis
The command automatically adapts its analysis patterns based on detected technology stack:
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Controllers, services, modules, DTOs
- **Python**: Classes, functions, Django models, Flask routes
- **Java**: Spring controllers, entities, repositories
- **C#/.NET**: Controllers, services, models, configurations
- **Go**: Handlers, structs, interfaces, packages
- And more...

### Intelligent Categorization
Commit analysis goes beyond simple message parsing:

#### Code Content Analysis
- Examines actual diff content to understand what changed
- Identifies patterns like `@Controller`, `CREATE TABLE`, `interface {}` 
- Categorizes work based on technical implementation details

#### Smart Grouping
- Groups similar work across team members
- Identifies project-wide initiatives and technical debt reduction
- Recognizes architectural improvements and infrastructure work

#### Context-Aware Narratives
- Generates human-readable summaries of technical accomplishments
- Explains the business impact of code changes
- Provides actionable insights for project management

### Management Insights

#### Risk Analysis
- **High Bug Fix Ratio**: Alerts when fixes exceed feature development
- **Single Contributor Risk**: Identifies knowledge sharing gaps
- **Work Distribution**: Flags unbalanced workload across team members
- **Documentation Gap**: Highlights missing documentation work

#### Productivity Metrics
- Lines of code per commit analysis with intelligent interpretation
- Commit frequency patterns and consistency tracking
- Team collaboration effectiveness measurement
- Development velocity categorization (Very High/High/Moderate/Low)

#### Recommendations
- Process improvement suggestions based on commit patterns
- Resource allocation recommendations for balanced team workload
- Quality assurance insights based on testing and documentation activity
