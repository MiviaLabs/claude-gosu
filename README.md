# Gosu Commands

> **âš¡ Optimized for Claude Code Max** - These commands work best with a Claude Code Max subscription for enhanced performance and capabilities.

Gosu is a collection of advanced Claude Code commands for comprehensive code analysis and improvement. These commands provide expert-level security auditing and code quality review with intelligent multi-agent coordination.

## Available Commands

| Command | Description | Documentation |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| `gosu:security` | Comprehensive cybersecurity analysis and vulnerability fixes | [Details](./docs/security.md) |
| `gosu:review` | Code quality review with intelligent improvements | [Details](./docs/review.md) |
| `gosu:plan` | Comprehensive feature planning with implementation roadmaps | [Details](./docs/plan.md) |

## Quick Start

All gosu commands follow the same pattern:

```bash
claude gosu:<command>
```

### Basic Usage Examples

```bash
# Security audit of your codebase
claude gosu:security

# Code quality review
claude gosu:review

# Feature planning and implementation
claude gosu:plan "user profile management with avatar upload"
```

## Key Features

### Language Agnostic
All commands automatically detect and adapt to any programming language or technology stack:
- JavaScript/TypeScript/Node.js
- Python (Django, Flask)
- Java (Spring, Maven)
- C#/.NET
- Go, Ruby, PHP, and more

### Intelligent Multi-Agent Coordination
Commands automatically determine when to use multiple agents based on:
- Issue count and complexity
- File distribution across the codebase
- Task independence
- Technology diversity

### User Control
All commands follow the same safe workflow:
1. Complete full analysis first
2. Present comprehensive findings
3. **Stop and ask for confirmation** before making changes
4. Offer options: Yes (full implementation), No (report only), Selective (choose specific fixes)

### Comprehensive Reporting
Each command provides:
- Executive summary with metrics
- Detailed findings with exact file/line references
- Priority-based classification (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Technology-specific recommendations
- Actionable improvement plans

## Command Options

When prompted after analysis, you can choose:

1. **Yes** - Create todo list and implement all priority fixes
2. **No** - Stop here, report only (no code changes)
3. **Selective** - Choose which specific issues to fix
4. **High Priority Only** - Fix only critical issues

## Best Practices

### Workflow Integration
```bash
# Before committing changes
claude gosu:review

# Before production deployment
claude gosu:security

# Planning new features
claude gosu:plan "real-time notifications system"

# Complete development cycle
claude gosu:plan "feature" && claude gosu:review && claude gosu:security
```

### When to Use Each Command

- **Security (`gosu:security`)**: Before deployments, after adding user input features, compliance audits
- **Review (`gosu:review`)**: Before PRs, after refactoring, regular code quality maintenance
- **Plan (`gosu:plan`)**: Before implementing new features, architectural changes, complex functionality

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Agent Coordination Example
For complex projects, commands may deploy multiple specialized agents:

```
> DEPLOYING MULTI-AGENT TEAM

Agent Distribution:
- Agent 1: Critical issues in auth/, api/
- Agent 2: Validation fixes in controllers/, middleware/
- Agent 3: Configuration hardening in config/, docker/
- Agent 4: Dependencies and documentation
```

Each agent works independently with specific expertise, then provides a coordinated summary of all improvements.

## Support
